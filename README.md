Task: Develop a program to encrypt (and similarly decrypt) a 64-bit plaintext using DES. Instead of using
an available library, I insist that you program any and every element of each of the 16 rounds of DES (and that means F-box, 32-
bit exchanges, generation of sub-key required in each round, etc.).
